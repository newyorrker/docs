## English | [中文](https://github.com/xuelongqy/vue-easyrefresh/blob/master/README.md)

Just like the name, EasyRefresh makes it easy to implement pull-down refresh and pull-up operations on Vue-based web applications, supporting mainstream PCs and mobile browsers. Its function is inspired by Android's SmartRefreshLayout, which also draws on the advantages of many three-party libraries. EasyRefresh integrates a variety of styles of Header and Footer, but it has no limitations, you can easily customize it to do whatever you want. Using Html's powerful animations, even a simple control can be done. The goal of EasyRefresh is to create a powerful, stable, and mature drop-down refresh framework.
